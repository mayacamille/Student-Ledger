Student Management System
I developed a Python-based student management system that enables administrators to store, search, and display student information in an organized manner. The project includes:

Admin Authentication: Secure login system for administrators.
Student Data Entry: Capture detailed student information such as personal data, courses, and grades.
Database Display: View all student records in a structured format.
Search Functionality: Quickly retrieve individual student details using a simple search by student number.
This project demonstrates my ability to build user-friendly interfaces, manage data, and apply input validation techniques in Python.
