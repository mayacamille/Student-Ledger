I developed a student management system using Python that enables administrators to store, search, and display student information in an organized table. 

To access the student database the username is 'Admin123' and the password is 'LastPast1'

The project includes:
- Admin Authentication: Secure login system for administrators.
- Student Data Entry: Stores detailed student information such as personal data, courses, and grades.
- Database Display: View all student records in a structured format.
- Search Functionality: Quickly retrieve individual student details using a simple search by student number.

This project demonstrates my ability to build user-friendly interfaces, manage data, and apply input validation while being able to incorporate features like file handling, ata validation, and advanced search options. I was able to showcase my understanding of core Python concepts like loops, functions, conditionals, and data structures (lists and dictionaries).
